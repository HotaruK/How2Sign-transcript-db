# How2Sign-transcript-db

## Overview
This is a database for retrieving video information from [How2Sign Dataset](https://how2sign.github.io/) transcripts.  
This database was created to improve the efficiency of my own master's research.  

## Reuse

However, the data in this database (/db/init.sql) is based on How2Sign data, so please follow their instructions if you need to reuse it.
